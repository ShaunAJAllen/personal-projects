# personal-projects
My personal projects that I have worked on outside of my university studies/projects

spotify.py: contains a function I wrote to return an access token to use for making requests to the Spotify API
StreamingHistory.ipynb: project where I use my Spotify streaming history (and audio features) in 2021 to make stream count predictions for my favourite 50 songs of the year
