# personal-projects
My personal projects that I have worked on outside of my university studies/projects

spotify.py: contains a function I wrote to return an access token to use for making requests to the Spotify API

StreamingHistory.ipynb: project where I use my Spotify streaming history (and audio features) in 2021 to make stream count predictions for my favourite 50 songs of the year

Last FM.R: a project I did before I retrieved my Spotify data where I used my Last FM data to produce my expected Spotify Wrapped results
